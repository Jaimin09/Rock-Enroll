# Rock-Enroll

### Rock-Enroll to Learn Together !

## The Problem 
Learning online is getting pretty boring. With COVID situation, students are affected in their education because they don't get proper engagement with their peers. Majority of the students reported that, online classes don't grasp their attention and its hard to resolve their doubts.

We came up with an interactive solution to get better engagement in the online classes. 

We call it ROCK-ENROLL !

## The Solution

Rock-Enroll is an Online Note sharing and Discussion platform for student to make learning experience more interactive.

Student can join channels and engage with other students, share notes in a particular channels and help each other with assignments, studies, learning, and doubt solving.

Sharing google-docs, or handwritted pdfs in whatsapp isn't organised and its hard to stay focused in it.

Our platform provides the most basic and useful Note-sharing and doubt-solving functionality in one place.

## Challenges we Face

Our major challenge was to keep the track of different channels and students in it. Creating a database for it was tricky. Also to create a group discussion chat, with different chats in different channels was a major challenge. But we overcame it with proper brainstorming.
